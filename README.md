PrintLetters
============

Print mnemonic combinations of 10-digit telephone numbers. These are combinations of letters and numbers 
that are easier to remember than 10 digits (using letters as shown on a telephone keyboard)

The portions that remain as numbers are:
* The country and area codes (traditionally left as is, for example 1-800)
* The numbers 1 and 0

The rest are converted to letters and the results printed out

A couple of days ago I was asked this question at a phone interview. I overcomplicated the answer and didn't get anywhere, 
which was tremendously annoying. After the interview I decided to write it out as an exercise anyway, just for my own sake.

Maybe someone actually has uses for this kind of functionality so I decided to upload it to Github.
Feel free to re-use it. I am releasing this code under a choice of MIT License or GPL v2 (your choice, pick one or the other). 
If you need different terms please let me know.
